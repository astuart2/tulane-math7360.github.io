## Introduction

## Course logistics

- Independent project:
  - Choose from a pool of subjects (to be provided)
  - Analyse your own data
- Present your project on November 18, 20, and 23.


## Giant's shoulders

- Previous lecture notes from Dr. Michelle Lacey (Math Department @ Tulane)

- Course material from Dr. Hua Zhou (Biostatistics Department @ UCLA)

- Various online sources

## Statistics and data science

- Statistics, the science of _data analysis_, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century.

- Data is increasing in [volume, velocity, and variety](http://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/).

- My favorite definition of a _data scientist_:

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.

| Data Size | Bytes          | Storage Mode               |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| tiny      | $10^2$         | piece of paper             |
| small     | $10^4$         | a few pieces of paper      |
| medium    | $10^6$ (MB)    | a floppy disk              |
| large     | $10^8$         | hard disk                  |
| huge      | $10^9$ (GB)    | hard disk(s)               |
| massive   | $10^{12}$ (TB) | hard disk(s); RAID storage |
