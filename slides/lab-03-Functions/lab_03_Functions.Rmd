## Vectorized calculation
Our final easy task for today: adding two vectors!

```{r}
set.seed(7360)        # what's this?  Don't worry, we will cover this later in class.
vector.1 <- rnorm(3)  # what does rnorm() do?
vector.2 <- rnorm(6)
vector.addition <- vector.1 + vector.2
```

> **Question 4** Explain what happens.

## Functions

override? masked?

## remove objects
